# marina
An abstract library that implements a topic-based publish/subscribe mechanism, 
and using the concept of the digital twins that include the interfaces to bind remote service providers, 
achieves the decoupling from specific network protocol libraries.

## Source of inspiration
At first, it was to build a stream-based message-hub service over the peer-to-peer network, 
which does not rely on the MQTT protocol. With the introduction of twin concept, 
it can be completely decoupled from the communication module, so that a peer-to-peer network is only an option, 
which can be a traditional cluster or a single-point server, and which can use the TCP or UDP protocol.  
So it has stronger flexibility and versatility.
