# marina
An abstract library that implements a topic-based publish/subscribe mechanism, 
and using the concept of the digital twins that include the interfaces to bind remote service providers, 
achieves the decoupling from specific network protocol libraries.

## low dependence
1. [cabinet](github.com/TheSmallBoat/cabinet) (Using the tree-structure topics manager.)
2. [kademlia](github.com/lithdew/kademlia) (Used for the twinâ€˜s identity, cause support the distributed system.)
3. [bytesutil](github.com/lithdew/bytesutil) (Used for the binary codec.)
4. [testify](github.com/stretchr/testify) (Used in testing.)
5. [goleak](go.uber.org/goleak) (Used in testing.)
